Java Rule Engine source files.

The Rule Engine allows to implement business rules in a central location and outside the code - be it a web application, a standalone application or any other java based tool - so that, if the rules change the code does not have to change but only the rules.

There is a web application available, which allows to define rules in an easy and quick way. yet very complex scenarios are possible by combining rules with "and" and "or" conditions and by grouping them together.
